# MathMe
An app for improving mental math.

This app is a personal project to practice android development and improve my skills. 

Math Me! is built using Android Studio and is written in Java and XML.

## App Features

- Different modes like test, timed, and infinite to help practice mental arithmetic skills
- Different settings within each mode like choosing operations, setting a number limit, and so on
- Keeps track of wrong answers when doing a mode and lists them at the end
- Uses the Android Room library and other Android architectural components like LiveData to store scores and the mode settings so that the user can monitor progress and sort scores(WIP)
- Notification reminder to practice math(WIP)
- Follows material design guidelines
- Has dark mode!
